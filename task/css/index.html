<p>This is perhaps the basic method of investing in an NFO. One can always reach out to a broker and they can help you invest in a new fund offer. Always make sure that the broker you are consulting is an authorized one. Your broker can help you out with completing all the formalities regarding the application for NFO. One of the most important benefits of investing through a broker is you get doorstep services and also information regarding the future performance of the fund that you are investing in.

    Through Online-trading account
    
    This is another method of investing and is convenient too. If you are already into investing in shares and mutual funds, you must have an online trading account. The same account can be used to invest in NFOs as well. The purchasing and selling of the NFO units can be done online. The online trading account can also be used to track the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the investments made.</p>
